        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
            I am a Buisness Computer Information Systems student at the Univeristy of North Texas. 
            Currently I tutor and grade for the ITDS department at UNT.
            I plan to graduate in December of 2018, and would like to find a rewarding job in IT. 
            For hobbies, I enjoy building and repairing custom PC's for myself, freinds and family along with occasional gaming on my free time.
